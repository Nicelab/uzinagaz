uzinagaz
========

`uzinagaz` is an experimental work in progres for an indoor gas mesurement tool.

The experimentation use:
- Cheap MQ gas sensors (COV, CO, CO2)
- DHT22 humidity & temperature sensor
- an Arduino UNO connected to the sensors
- a Raspebery Pi as a controler and data loger

For the software part:
- [Python Arduino Command API](https://github.com/thearn/Python-Arduino-Command-API)
- [Emoncms](http://emoncms.org/)


Warning
-------

This is an early work in progress, nothing is set to stone.
For example:
- the main code is in Python, but this may change over time
- the Arduino and/or the Raspberry Pi may be completly droped
- sensors models may be replaced

The main objective is to experiment, hack and learn things.
